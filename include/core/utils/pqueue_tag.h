 * @brief Priority queue that uses tags for sorting.
 * 
 * This file extends the pqueue infrastructure with support for queues that are sorted
 * by tag instead of by a long long.  Elements in this queue are structs of type
 * pqueue_tag_element_t or a derived struct, as explained below. What you put onto the
 * queue is a pointer to a tagged_element_t struct. That pointer, when cast to pqueue_pri_t,
 * an alias for long long, also serves as the "priority" for the queue.

/**
 * @brief The type for an element in a priority queue that is sorted by tag.
 * 
 * In this design, a pointer to this struct is also a "priority" (it can be
 * cast to pqueue_pri_t).  The actual priority is the tag field of the struct,
 * in that the queue is sorted from least tag to largest.
 * 
 * If your struct is dynamically allocated using malloc or calloc, and you
 * would like the memory freed when the queue is freed, then set the is_dynamic
 * field to a non-zero value.
 * 
 * To customize the element you put onto the queue, you can create your
 * own element struct type by simply declaring the first field to be
 * a pqueue_tag_element_t.  For example, if you want an element of the
 * queue to include a pointer to your own payload, you can declare the
 * following struct type:
 * <pre>
 *     typedef struct {
 *         pqueue_tag_element_t base;
 *         my_type* my_payload;
 *     } my_element_type_t;
 * </pre>
 * When inserting your struct into the queue, simply cast your pointer
 * to (pqueue_tag_element_t*).  When accessing your struct from the queue,
 * simply cast the result to (my_element_type_t*);
